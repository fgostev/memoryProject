To do:

Components:
Create components for cards
Create a game board where I display 8 cards at the time,
   on a click will randomize and update the sate of the score
Create a score that track right and wrong
Create game mechanics - add event listeners on each card 
    -Randomized after click
    -score update


    Brainstorm:

   -header will have name and score
    -On game board will show all the cards
    -Game function will have the logic.
  
  Plan for today:
  - set up the functionality for the app"
  -Work on the leaderboard function. The leaderboard must:
   1) Remember all clicked cards. 
   -Push into an array every time a card clicked. 
   -Check every time click on the card if the card matches any itme on the array
   -If the card matches - reset score. 
   2) If the card has been clicked before place the best score and
   restart.
